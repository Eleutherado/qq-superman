#QQ-Superman
This tool allows learners to see which questions a video answers, vote whether it did answer the question, and add a new one if they think it's answered in the video.
Additionally, learners are asked to answer the question they are interested in at the end of the video. This supports their retention and removes assumptions of what they know as they have to make their knowledge explicit.
